# Local-RAG

## Local RAG implementation using Ollama open source libraries for parsing through user-inputted files.

As a part of an onboarding project for my summer internship, I was tasked with implementing a basic RAG of my choosing. Through following online documentation and youtube tutorials, I decided upon using Ollama's open source LLM models to develop a simple RAG that answers user prompts regarding files inputted.

The basic flow involves users providing markdown files to the model, and subsequently providing prompts for the model to parse and answer given the context of the markdown file.

## Future Areas of Improvement

As this was my first implementation of a chatbot model, there are some areas that could be improved upon, including...

• Expanding the document types to beyond markdown files.  
• Integrating updated Ollama LLM models, or possibly other popular LLM model types.  
• Implementing a different form of document parsing as opposed to chunking, one option could be the use of knowledge graphs.
